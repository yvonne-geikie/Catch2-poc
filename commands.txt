Brand new build:
1. Navigate to the `secondCatch2` directory:
    ```
    cd /c:/Example/secondCatch2
    ```
2. Create a new `build` directory:
    ```
    mkdir build
    ```
3. Change to the `build` directory:
    ```
    cd build
    ```
4. Generate the build system files using CMake:
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```
5. Build the project:
    ```
    cmake --build .
    ```

For small modifications like updating a file, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you are in the `build` directory:
    ```
    cd /c:/Example/secondCatch2/build
    ```
2. Regenerate the build system files using CMake:
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```
3. Rebuild the project:
    ```
    cmake --build .
    ```

To run the executable:
1. Change to the `Debug` directory:
    ```
    cd Debug
    ```
2. Execute the test executable:
    ```
    .\test_math.exe
    .\test_string.exe
    ```
